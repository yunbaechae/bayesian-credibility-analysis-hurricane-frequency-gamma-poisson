# Bayesian Credibility Analysis of Hurricane Frequency Using Gamma-Poisson Model

ACST3061 Actuarial Modelling Assignment 2 (2023)

This assignment applied Bayesian credibility theory to model hurricane frequency with Gamma-Poisson distribution. Focused on posterior inference, credibility premium, and quantitative risk assessment.

## Key Tasks
- Fitted Gamma-Poisson Bayesian model to hurricane data  
- Computed posterior distributions and credibility factors  
- Evaluated quantitative risk and financial impact  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Bayesian credibility and Gamma-Poisson modelling  
- Posterior estimation and credibility calculation  
- Quantitative risk prediction and validation  

## Submission Details
- The attached PDF is the rendered output from an original R Markdown (.Rmd) document.  
  (Original .Rmd source file is no longer available, but the PDF preserves all code, models, posteriors, and results.)
